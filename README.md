ALPHA V8.1.1 - 12-4-2020

Tetra Legends Enhanced is a fork of Tetra Legends created by Dr. Ocelot which is a Tetris clone in HTML5.

Tetra Legends Enhanced was created after his announcement of retirement from the Tetris community, and, as such, the discontinuation of the original Tetra Legends.
I am starting this project while knowing very little about HTML5 as a whole, but I will definitely be attempting to add new things for as long as I can.

My main goal starting out is to figure out how everything in Tetra Legends works first, only __then__ will I start to add Arcade modes and more QOL features.

The entirety of Tetra Legends Enhanced was made possible __ONLY__ because of the work that Dr. Ocelot has done to make the original game in the first place, and for that, I thank him for creating such a great game to actually play.
